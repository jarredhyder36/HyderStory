Fascinating story about Hyder
I woke up in the morning and thanked God.
I don't know but today seemed kind of odd.
There was no barking from the dogs, no smog.
And my mom cooked breakfast with no hog.
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out.
Finally got to work on a tunnel I want to dig out.
Hooked it up as I hit the door.
Thinking will I live another 24.
